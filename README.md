# Hackathon_NCState_CodeBlack_2024
This repository contains the program for the NCState hackathon (in partnership with Code Black) for 2024.  
It contains a python program that utilizes tkinter and turtle to gather data input by the user for any number of animals that are all part of the same species.  The user then inputs data about that animal's life cycle (birth date, date at which it reaches maturity, etc.) and the program analyzes and summarizes the data.
